This bachelor thesis deals with a design and implementation of application for controlling computer with moving hand gestures. We describe design of basic algorithm and design of suitable architecture of artificial neural network for hand recognition. We will show basic methods of image preprocessing, that will help us increase success of recognition.

Next, we describe classes and their methods and implementation of the application.
